## Introduction

The finance industry has changed drastically over the past few decades. The rise in technology has pushed companies within the industry to explore new innovative ways of doing business, while maintaining the quality of services that are provided. Digitalizing services increase operational efficiencies by reducing the time it takes to execute certain tasks, as well reducing costs by removing the middle-man or intermediary. Developing smartphone apps for these services have the potential to increase the target market and give more people the opportunity to invest, as it's now easily accessible. 

## Overview and Origin

Navid Boostani recognized the need for a robo advising service that charged minimal fees while providing exceptional service. In 2013, he founded ModernAdvisor which is an online investment company that allows investors to build portfolios and manage their invesments.

Their services have the capability to rebalance their customer’s portoflios in order to adjust to market conditions. This is to ensure each investor's portfolio is still suitable.

They raised $2.2 Million in funding in 2015, provided by their lead investor Moray Keith and Conconi Growth Partners, and began operating in 2016.
