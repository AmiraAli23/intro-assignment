## Introduction

The finance industry has changed drastically over the past few decades. The rise in technology has pushed companies within the industry to explore new innovative ways of doing business, while maintaining the quality of services that are provided. Digitalizing services increase operational efficiencies by reducing the time it takes to execute certain tasks, as well reducing costs by removing the middle-man or intermediary. Developing smartphone apps for these services have the potential to increase the target market and give more people the opportunity to invest, as it's now easily accessible. 

## Overview and Origin

Navid Boostani recognized the need for a robo advising service that charged minimal fees while providing exceptional service. In 2013, he founded ModernAdvisor which is an online investment company that allows investors to build portfolios and manage their invesments.

Their services have the capability to rebalance their customerâ€™s portoflios in order to adjust to market conditions. This is to ensure each investor's portfolio is still suitable. If the investments in the account deviate more than 5% from their targets, there is an automatic rebalancing that is triggered that shifts the weights back to the target. [Source](https://help.modernadvisor.ca/en/articles/4199089-how-does-rebalancing-work)

They raised $2.2 Million in funding in 2015, provided by their lead investor Moray Keith and Conconi Growth Partners, and began operating in 2016. [The information below](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/modernadvisor/company_financials) was retreived through CrunchBase.

### How it works

ModernAdvisor uses low cost, exchange traded funds to customize portfolios, suited to each of their customer's needs. As shown on their website, the risk levels vary from 1-10 and their performance based on those risk levels can be visualized. For example, a socially responsible portfolio with a risk level of 1's performance can be seen below.

   > The dip in early 2020 can be explained because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the mass uncertainty/volatility that followed.

## Business Activities

The company was looking to address the need for cheaper services within the industry. Many of their competitors charge higher mangement fees or MER (Management Expense Ratio). However once these metrics are compared to the competitors in the industry, the fees are either on par or higher than their competiors. Below is a comparison of fee percentages for $2,500, $10,000, and $100,000 accounts. 

<img width="761" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 6 10 29 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/154868529-d09b781f-216c-4a78-a18e-6776efca794b.png">

   > For a $2,500 account, Modernadvisor charges roughly one-third of its peers.

<img width="772" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 6 10 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/154868538-a324fa86-296f-4419-9805-8b92ebc5b5c3.png">

   > In this case, the fee percentages charged by ModernAdvisor are higher than both of the competitors.

At first glance, one would assume the intended customer would be individuals who are well-versed and trust technology, individuals who could have lower income hence the push for lower fees, and targeted towards Millenials (emphasizing their option for socially responsible portfolios as Millenials typically invest in socially responsible stocks [Source](https://fortune.com/2021/11/18/millennials-genz-investing-markets-wealth-transfer/). However it is apparent, through their new account/sign up website, that ModernAdvisor is looking to take on seasoned investors and those individuals that can be "vouched" for. If one were to try creating an account, they are prompted by the following message 

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/154868925-f2978f27-48dd-4a47-9264-0a715b4961d8.png">

   > Users are required to enter in a referral code from a financial planner, friend, or referral. 

This has a signficant negative impact on their business. By creating new accounts through referrals, they are limiting their customer base and in a sense, "gatekeeping" their service. Their website promotes transparency and cost effective services however make it incredibly difficult to access said services. 


One feature setting ModernAdvisor apart from its competitors is the option to have a "trial" for their first $1,000 invested and "call" their option. In thirty days, depending on if the value of their investment increased or decreased, they have the option to opt out with no loss, or realize the gains [Source](https://www.modernadvisor.ca/trial/). This option is enticing and gives investors a peek into their possible future portfolios.

The technology that ModernAdvisor utilizes is not showcased or mentioned on their site. Navigating through the site, it is apparent they use "Intercom" as a channel to communicate with investors and possible investors.

## Landscape

ModernAdvisor is in the "robo-advising" domain of Fintech. Robo-advising is a technological services that uses formulas, algorithms and other code to produce investment advice and portfolios. Users are reequired to fill out a questionairre that gathers information regarding income, risk appetite, financial goals, and other demographic information. The more extensive the questionairre is, the better as it will better suit the investor's needs. 

As technology is becoming more integrated in each industry, robo advising has been on the rise since its introduction in 2008 [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp). Below is a graph showing the value of assets under management (AuM) by robo advisors from 2018 to a projected 2023.

Because its self managed, it is commission-free and generally a lot cheaper than robo advisors.

## Results

ModernAvisor allows its users the option to invest in a socially responsible manner. As mentioned earlier, the markets have seen a higher demand for socially responsible options. ModernAdvisor recognized the need and emphasized the importance of ESG investing on their website. As stated on their site, they do not invest in companies that are involved in producing tobacco or weapons. [Source](https://www.modernadvisor.ca/socially-responsible-investing/) . Making these products more available to investors will help the environement and defund socially irresponsible companies. 


MER refers to the Management Expense Ratio and is defined as the cost to manage ivestments [Source](https://www.rbcgam.com/en/ca/learn-plan/types-of-investments/what-is-a-management-expense-ratio-mer/detail) 

Robo-advising companies charge an MER on top of their existing management fees. According to [Rate Hub](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/management-expense-ratio-definition/), the average MER that is imposed by Robo-advising companies is around 0.5%. 

Below is a chart that shows the MER and management fees charged by the leading robo-advising companies. Modernadvisor is shown at the end.

   > Compared to their biggest competitors, WealthSimple and RBC InvestEase, ModernAdvisor's MER is on par, if not higher. 

Another metric to compare results is the after fee annualized total returns. Below are the returns for one, three, and five year growth portfolios.

   > ModernAdvisor performs somewhere in between its competitors for the three year portfolio.

   > For the five year portfolios, ModernAdvisor underperforms compared to their competitors. 

[Tables Source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/article-presenting-canadas-cheapest-robo-adviser-the-best-performers-and-the/)

Through these tables, it is shown that ModernAdvisor growth portfolios held for a longer period of time do not perform as well as their competitors. This might sway the investor away from ModernAdvisor's services if they are looking to invest longer term. Short term investors might see the one year returns and be more likely to use their services.
