# ModernAdvisor

![alt_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/154779897-675790a6-e10a-4125-96a7-a25c812e7525.png)

## Introduction

The finance industry has changed dramatically over the last few decades. The rise in technology has pushed companies within the industry to explore new innovative ways of doing business, while maintaining the quality of services that are provided. Digitalizing services increases operational efficiencies by reducing the time that it takes to execute certain functions, as well as reducing costs by removing the intermediary or "middle-man". Developing smartphone apps for these services has the potential to widen the target market and give more people the opportunity to invest, as it makes investing more easily accessible. ModernAdvisor, which operates under the Robo-Advising fintech domain, is a product of this modernization of finance.

## Overview and Origin

Navid Boostani wanted to address the need in the market for low-cost services. while also wanting to provide exceptional service. In 2013, he founded ModernAdvisor which is an online investment company that allows investors to build portfolios and manage their invesments. In January 2020, ModernAdvisor was acquired by Guardian Capital, a Canadian financial services company that grossed $97.48 million in the third quarter of 2021 [Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/GCG.A.TO/revenues)

Included in the services offered by the company is the ability rebalance their customer’s portoflios in order to adjust to market conditions. This is done to ensure each investor's portfolio is still suitable. If the investments in the account deviate more than 5% from their targets, an automatic rebalancing is triggered to shift the weights back to the target. [Source](https://help.modernadvisor.ca/en/articles/4199089-how-does-rebalancing-work)

They raised $2.2 Million in funding in 2015 through their lead investor, Moray Keith and Conconi Growth Partners, and began operating in 2016. [The information below](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/modernadvisor/company_financials) was retreived through CrunchBase.

### How it Works

ModernAdvisor uses low-cost, exchange traded funds to customize portfolios, suited to each customer's needs. 

They offer 2 portfolios: core and socially responsible. Socially resposible portfolios invest in companies that don't have a negative impact on the environment, and companies who are not involved in the production of weaponry and tobacco.

As shown on their website, the risk levels vary from 1-10 and the performance based on these risk levels can be visualized. For example, below is the performance of a socially responsible portfolio with a risk level of `1`:.

   > The dip in early 2020 can be explained because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the mass uncertainty/volatility that followed.

## Business Activities

ModernAdvisor's [mission statement](https://www.modernadvisor.ca/team/) declares the goal of "help[ing] Canadians gain access to high quality, low-cost investment advice – regardless of their net worth."

Presented with this information, the following assumptions can be made regarding the target customer:

* Technologically literate
* Novice investor
* Diverse net-worth
* Millenial 
   * An emphasis is placed on socially responsible portfolios, which are typically sought after by Millenials [Source](https://fortune.com/2021/11/18/millennials-genz-investing-markets-wealth-transfer/). 

However, it is apparent through their new account/sign up website, that ModernAdvisor is looking to take on seasoned investors and those individuals that can be "vouched" for. If one were to try creating an account, they are met with the following message 

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/154868925-f2978f27-48dd-4a47-9264-0a715b4961d8.png">

   > Users are required to enter in a referral code from a financial planner, friend, or referral. 

This may have a signficant negative impact on their business. Limiting new clients through referrals, narrows their customer base entirely, and in a sense, "gatekeeps" their service. So, while their mission statement seems to widen the net for many potential investors, their practices seem to go against this entirely.


Regarding the service charges, the claim is that they are lower than competitors' fees or MER (Management Expense Ratio,) however, once these metrics are compared, it is apparent that the fees are either on par or higher than their competiors. Below is a comparison of fee percentages for $2,500, $10,000, and $100,000 accounts. 

<img width="761" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 6 10 29 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/154868529-d09b781f-216c-4a78-a18e-6776efca794b.png">

   > For a $2,500 account, Modernadvisor charges roughly one-third of its peers.

   > In this case, the fee percentages charged by ModernAdvisor are higher than both of the competitors.

One feature that sets ModernAdvisor apart from its competitors is the option to have a "trial" for their first $1,000 invested and "call" their option. In thirty days, depending on if the value of their investment increased or decreased, they have the option to opt out with no loss, or realize the gains [Source](https://www.modernadvisor.ca/trial/). This option is enticing and gives investors a peek into their possible future portfolios.

The technology that ModernAdvisor utilizes is not showcased or mentioned on their site. Navigating through the site, it is apparent they use "Intercom" as a channel to communicate with investors and possible investors.

## Landscape

ModernAdvisor is in the "robo-advising" domain of Fintech. Robo-advising includes technological services that use formulas, algorithms, and other code to produce investment advice and portfolios. Users are required to fill out a questionnaire that gathers information regarding income, risk appetite, financial goals, and other demographic information. A more extensive questionnaire will better understand the investor's needs. 

As technology is becoming more integrated in each industry, robo-advising has been on the rise since its introduction in 2008 [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp). Below is a graph showing the value of assets under management (AuM) by robo advisors from 2018 to a projected 2023. 

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155822630-63bec423-af85-4940-9eff-098bf893c9de.png">

They are projecting a downward trend because of the rise in self managed services that institutions like BMO and Scotiabank offer e.g BMO InvestorLine. Because its self managed, it is commission-free and generally a lot cheaper than robo advisors.

## Results

ModernAvisor allows its users the option to invest in a socially responsible manner. As mentioned earlier, the markets have seen a higher demand for socially responsible options. ModernAdvisor recognized the need and emphasized the importance of ESG investing on their website. As stated on their site, they do not invest in companies that are involved in producing tobacco or weapons. [Source](https://www.modernadvisor.ca/socially-responsible-investing/) . Making these products more available to investors will help the environement and defund socially irresponsible companies. 


MER refers to the Management Expense Ratio and is defined as the cost to manage ivestments [Source](https://www.rbcgam.com/en/ca/learn-plan/types-of-investments/what-is-a-management-expense-ratio-mer/detail) 

Robo-advising companies charge an MER on top of their existing management fees. According to [Rate Hub](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/management-expense-ratio-definition/), the average MER that is imposed by Robo-advising companies is around 0.5%. 

Below is a chart that shows the MER and management fees charged by the leading robo-advising companies. Modernadvisor is shown at the end. 

<img width="553" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 9 27 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155825488-8dbbfb98-b297-4b3f-b4bd-da52a64f2550.png">
   
   > Compared to their biggest competitors, WealthSimple and RBC InvestEase, ModernAdvisor's MER is on par, if not higher. 

Another metric to compare results is the after fee annualized total returns. Below are the returns for one, three, and five year growth portfolios.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155825830-b667ba1d-957c-487f-bb2e-1c030ab03a79.png">

   > ModernAdvisor outperforms its competitors for a one year portfolio.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155825855-5700df2a-886e-4006-b51a-a33eaa64a80a.png">

   > ModernAdvisor performs somewhere in between its competitors for the three year portfolio. 

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155825929-a55d48c9-00cd-4b10-84c6-e97fc8c7046b.png">

   > For the five year portfolios, ModernAdvisor underperforms compared to their competitors. 

[Tables Source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/article-presenting-canadas-cheapest-robo-adviser-the-best-performers-and-the/)

Through these tables, it is shown that ModernAdvisor growth portfolios held for a longer period of time do not perform as well as their competitors. This might sway the investor away from ModernAdvisor's services if they are looking to invest longer term. Short term investors might see the one year returns and be more likely to use their services. 

## Recommendations

### Main Issues : Advertising & Outreach 

For a company that claims to be "Modern", their website and features are fairly outdated. Their website is dull and it is difficult to gather any information directly from the source. The lack of transparency contradicts their [claims](https://www.modernadvisor.ca/advantages/) of being transparent. Their website should have more information regarding their assets held under management, the number of clients they have, as well as their financials. 

I also recommend for the company to be more inclusive, and allow sign-ups without a referral.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155826232-a1efe061-156f-43b5-b283-a0c2d1dcf506.png">

The reason why apps like Wealthsimple are wildly successful is because of their inclusivity. Investors from diverse income brackets and social demographics are given the opportunity to invest, whereas ModernAdvisor seems to be selective of the portfolios they wish to manage. This only limits their own potential for growth.

Outreach and Advertising are the main issues with this company. It is difficult for a company to get new clients if they aren't providing any marketing material. Apps such as Wealthsimple utilize platforms such as TikTok and YouTube to advertise their services. With millenials and Gen Z becoming more interested in investing, it is important to ensure all demographics of the market are reached. They currently have a blog on their website, which aside from being outdated, isn't updated very frequently. Generally, people aren't interested in reading large amount of texts, and prefer visuals or short videos. It is also important to break down complex information for users to make it easily understandable.

TikTok would be an ideal platform that they could use to advertise their services and get the younger generations engaged and interested in investing. Currently, they are waiting for people to find them, when it should be the other way around. 

Robo-advising is generally targeted towards novice investors and generations that grew up around technology, and their marketing and website should reflect as such. Seasoned investors might be less inclined to use their services, as they aren't providing a product that "hasn't been seen before". The main feature setting them apart from their competitors is their trial feature which the details have to be searched for and found on their site. 

ModernAdvisor should utilize other marketing technologies to not only reflect their name, but to reach a wider consumer base. Below is what they currently use for their marketing technologies. [Source](https://www.slintel.com/company/modernadvisor/5c3b00bcd55ae49f1b76e13a)

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99091066/155826540-d9e9a4f4-f07b-4073-93cf-9f565c2297d2.png">

Searching the hashtag "#ModernAdvisor", generates only a handful of results. Their own page "@ModernAdvsr" last tweeted in May of 2021. In contrast to WealthSimple that has 84.1 thousand followers and is active on their twitter page. A competent marketing stragety is decider of the sucess of a company. Wealthsimple has an aggresive marketing strategy that targets users on social media. They now manage over $6billion in assets, which can largely be accredited to their marketing techniques [source](https://northbeach.media/why-wealthsimple-has-a-winning-marketing-strategy/). If Modernadvisor took to other social media platforms, they could gain traction.

Twitter is a modern platform that many generations use, however their approach to using it is very passive. Their marketing team should be more proactive on the site, by engaging with other users and using the platform to promote their services. 

ModernAdvisor and their trial feature, in theory, is a great idea, however their execution and marketing technologies need to be updated to become more relevant and accessible in order to reach a wider consumer base.
